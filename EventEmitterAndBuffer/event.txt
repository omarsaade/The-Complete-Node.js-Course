fs module : mohemta to deal with files (create,,read,,delete..)
http module : allow us to listen on a specific port and receive http req and send http request

=======================
In assembly lang we use an assembler to convert our code into zeros
and ones

In C++ lang we useed g plus plus which is  a compiler that converts our
C++ code into machine code

In javascript we use a javascript engine(spidermonkey) to do thatq  

now a javascript engine that we are going to talk about and nodejs and google
chrome are using it is and its also the fastest javascript engine out there is
V8

v8 was introduced by google in 2008
and Ryan dial creator of nodejs used that v8 engine to create node


=============================================
const http = require("http");
const fs = require("fs/promises");

const PORT = 8000;
// req and res Obj
const server = http.createServer(async (req, res) => {
  const contentBuffer = await fs.readFile(__dirname + "/text.txt");
  res.statusCode = 200;
  res.setHeader("Content-Type", "text/plain");
  // decoding
  res.end(contentBuffer.toString("utf-8"));
});

server.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`server has started on port ${PORT}`);
});


=======================================================
node js object is the event emitter object.

Removing Listener: The eventEmitter.removeListener() takes two argument 
event and listener, and removes that listener from the listeners array that is 
subscribed to that event. While eventEmitter.removeAllListeners()
 removes all the listener from the array which are subscribed to the mentioned event.

 //eventEmitter.removeListener(event, listener)
//eventEmitter.removeAllListeners([event])
